<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ME</h1>
<h2>MY TOP THREE MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Jeans</h3>
<p>Directed by Shankar, its one of the best movies a till time in tamil cinema</p>
<h3>Kandukondedn kandukonden</h3>
<p>starring Tabu and aishwarya rai, the story revolves around a wealthy family loosing the same and the dynamics
after that as the two female leads fall in love</p>
<h3>Rythm</h3>
<p>This romantic drama was way progress than its age, and a nice auditory experience delivered by 
AR Rahman through his music and BGM.
